# How to Add to StreamElements?!?

1. Create a Brand New Overlay
2. Add a new Widget and select "Static/Custom" followed by Custom Widget
3. Select the Widget under Layers on the left. Select Open Editor. This will give you a code screen with several tabs. DON'T BE SCARED. For each tab, delete everything that exists and paste the related content from the files listed in this folder into the editor and save.

NOTE: 

html -> html

css -> css

js -> js

json -> fields

data -> DELETE IT ALL
